# JS30-MW
Javascript 30-day challenge with Wes Bos.  Files were originally forked, now are downloaded with a gitignore for Node Modules.

The files are commented heavily with explanations of what each block of code is doing.  The first 15 days have a blank 'START' file
that I can use to practice the skills learned.  For those 15 days the START.1 file is the file I worked on alongside the video.
