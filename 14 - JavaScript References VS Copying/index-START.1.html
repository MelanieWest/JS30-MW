    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2);
    age =200;
    console.log(age,age2);

    let name = 'Mel';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name,name2);
    name = 'West';
    console.log(name,name2);
    //the point here is that the second variable will not change
    //when the original is updated
    

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it. (just set a new var equal to the array)
    const team = players;   //this is a REFERENCE to the original array, not a copy

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    
          //using the chrome dev tools console, we see that BOTH arrays were modified.  Wierd!!


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because 'team' is an array REFERENCE, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!




    // So, how do we fix this? We take a COPY instead!

    // one way (slice, without specifying start and stop indices)

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array (brackets) and concat the old one in
    const team3= [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread(it 'spreads out' the items of the original array)
    const team4 = [...players];
 
    // also...
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
  
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    
    team2[1]= 'Kitty';
    console.log('team2: ',team2);
    console.log('players: ',players);

    team4[2] = 'Joe';
    console.log('team4: ',team4);
    console.log('players: ',players);

    team5[3] = 'Honey';
    console.log('team5: ',team5);
    console.log('players: ',players);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy (this is a reference, not a copy):
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number =99;
    // captain.age = 33;

    // console.log('person: ',person,'captain: ',captain);
    

    // how do we make a copy instead?

    //for Object.assign, start with a blank object, then name the object to copy;
    //I can also 'fold in' (add or change) new properties in the object

    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{number:99, age:21});
    console.log('person: ',person,'\n','cap2: ',cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person}; //similar to React.  It's not there yet
    
     //this will copy the first level;  the second level deep is a reference
     //and can be changed.

    const mel = {
      name: 'Mel',
      age: 55,
      contact: {
        email: 'dhmofan@gmail.com',
        phone: 4071234567
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log('mel before mods: ',mel);   //this is altered too!  unexpected...
    
    const child = Object.assign({},mel);
    child.contact.email='thekid@yahoo.com';
    child.name = 'favorite';
    child.age =12;
    console.log('mel after mods: ',mel);
    console.log('child: ',child);

    mel.contact.email='dhmofan@gmail.com';    //this resets all parent and child objects retroactively

    //this is the 'poor man's' solution to deep cloning of an object    
    const redHeadedStepChild = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mel));
    redHeadedStepChild.contact.email='Iwish@yahoo.com';
    redHeadedStepChild.name = 'non-favorite';
    redHeadedStepChild.age = 12;

    console.log('mel after mods: ',mel);
    console.log('redHeadedStepChild: ',redHeadedStepChild);

    //this works because json stringify returns a string and not an object, so references are lost;

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
